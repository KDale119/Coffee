            Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the
            ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says
            the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these
            beloved beans.
          </p>
          <p>
            The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed
            that after eating the berries from a certain tree, his goats became
            so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who
            made a drink with the berries and found that it kept him alert
            through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his
            discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of
            the energizing berries began to spread.
          </p>
          <p>
            As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian Peninsula, it
            began a journey which would bring these beans across the globe.

          <p>
            Coffea arabica is today grown in dozens of countries between the
            Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer. Wild plants grow
            between 30 and 39 ft tall and have an open branching system. The
            leaves are opposite, simple elliptic-ovate to oblong 2.5–4.5 in long
            and 1.5–3 in a dark glossy green. The flowers are white, 10–15 mm in
            diameter and grow in clusters.

            Three of Colombia's most distinguished coffees—Medellin, Armenia,
            and Manizales are named after the region in which they were grown
            and then often marketed together to simplify the transfers of large
            coffee contracts. These coffees are known by the acronym MAM.

          <p>
            Robusta coffee refers to coffee that comes from the plant species
            Coffea canephora. Coffea canephora is one of the two primary species
            of coffee plants cultivated around our world, the other being Coffea
            arabica, or “Arabica” coffee. Though Arabica used to dominate global
            coffee production over Robusta by a wide margin—around 80/20—these
            days, Robusta now makes up a little more than 40% of coffee grown
            worldwide, according to
            <a href="https://worldcoffeeresearch.org/">World Coffee Research</a
            >.

          <p>
            One of the oldest, simplest, fastest and cheapest ways to brew
            coffee is the drip method using a coffee cone and paper filter. Hot
            water is poured evenly over coffee grounds in a paper filter. With
            gravity, the brewed coffee drips slowly and directly into a cup or
            pot.

          <p>
            The French Press method, invented in 1929, extracts arguably more
            superior flavors than any other method. In a press pot, ground
            coffee is soaked, steeped and strained in hot water; therefore,
            coffee’s flavorful essential oils, caffeine and antioxidants are
            better diffused and preserved leaving the purest flavors of the
            coffee.

          <p>
            Espresso is not a type of coffee bean or a roasting style – a common
            misconception. It's a process of brewing coffee and is instead made
            by forcing high-pressured hot water through very finely ground
            coffee beans. This is then topped with a crema, a brown foam, that
            adds the rich, full-flavored aftertaste.
