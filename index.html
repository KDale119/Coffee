            Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the
            ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says
            the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these
            beloved beans.
          </p>
          <p>
            The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed
            that after eating the berries from a certain tree, his goats became
            so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who
            made a drink with the berries and found that it kept him alert
            through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his
            discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of
            the energizing berries began to spread.
          </p>
          <p>
            As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian Peninsula, it
            began a journey which would bring these beans across the globe.
