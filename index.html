              Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to
              the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. There, legend
              says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these
              beloved beans.
            </p>
            <p>
              The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed
              that after eating the berries from a certain tree, his goats
              became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery,
              who made a drink with the berries and found that it kept him alert
              through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his
              discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of
              the energizing berries began to spread.
            </p>
            <p>
              As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian Peninsula, it
              began a journey which would bring these beans across the globe.

              Coffea arabica is today grown in dozens of countries between the
              Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer. Wild plants grow
              between 30 and 39 ft tall and have an open branching system. The
              leaves are opposite, simple elliptic-ovate to oblong 2.5–4.5 in
              long and 1.5–3 in a dark glossy green. The flowers are white,
              10–15 mm in diameter and grow in clusters.

              Three of Colombia's most distinguished coffees—Medellin, Armenia,
              and Manizales are named after the region in which they were grown
              and then often marketed together to simplify the transfers of
              large coffee contracts. These coffees are known by the acronym
              MAM.

            <p>
              Robusta coffee refers to coffee that comes from the plant species
              Coffea canephora. Coffea canephora is one of the two primary
              species of coffee plants cultivated around our world, the other
              being Coffea arabica, or “Arabica” coffee. Though Arabica used to
              dominate global coffee production over Robusta by a wide
              margin—around 80/20—these days, Robusta now makes up a little more
              than 40% of coffee grown worldwide, according to
              <a href="https://worldcoffeeresearch.org/"
                >World Coffee Research</a

              One of the oldest, simplest, fastest and cheapest ways to brew
              coffee is the drip method using a coffee cone and paper filter.
              Hot water is poured evenly over coffee grounds in a paper filter.
              With gravity, the brewed coffee drips slowly and directly into a
              cup or pot.

            <p>
              The French Press method, invented in 1929, extracts arguably more
              superior flavors than any other method. In a press pot, ground
              coffee is soaked, steeped and strained in hot water; therefore,
              coffee’s flavorful essential oils, caffeine and antioxidants are
              better diffused and preserved leaving the purest flavors of the
              coffee.

            <p>
              Espresso is not a type of coffee bean or a roasting style – a
              common misconception. It's a process of brewing coffee and is
              instead made by forcing high-pressured hot water through very
              finely ground coffee beans. This is then topped with a crema, a
              brown foam, that adds the rich, full-flavored aftertaste.
